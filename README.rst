Async Django Chat Application
=============================

This is an asynchronous chat application built with Django and Django Channels. It allows multiple users to join a room and chat in real-time. The application also includes a feature to search and play music from YouTube inline in chats.

Features
--------

1. **Real-time chat:** Users can join a chat room and send messages in real-time.
   
2. **YouTube integration:** Users can search for music on YouTube and play it directly in the chat room. The application uses the pytube library to search for YouTube videos and download the audio.
   
3. **Special commands:** Users can use special commands to interact with the YouTube feature. For example, `!search <query>` to search for music and `!play <index>` to play a specific result.
